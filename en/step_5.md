## Challenge: Changing the sample
Can you change the sample used?

To see what loop samples are available, you can go to <a href="http://jumpto.cc/sonic-pi-samples">jumpto.cc/sonic-pi-samples</a>, or just type `sample :loop` and choose from the list that appears.

You might also need to change the numbers in your code for different samples. You can use the following code to find out the sample of a duration:

`puts sample_duration(:sample_name)`

To loop a sample without a gap, __make sure that both numbers match__.
